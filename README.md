# Contagion
Extremely simplistic illustration of how a virus can spread among a community of individuals who come into contact as they move. There is no concept of immunity, an infected individual gets cured after a while and is susceptible to infection again. Also nobody dies.

For best results, try contagion rates between 1/2 and 1/5 (the odds of an infection taking place upon contact).
